# KCD Suisse Romande 2025

<img style="float:right; width:300px;" src="./images/logo.png">

In December 2025, join us at CERN for Kubernetes Community Days (KCD)!
This will be a full-day day event, focused on cloud native projects and the local community.
The talks will be in both French and English.
We plan to have about 300 participants.

KCDs are community-organized events that gather adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities for education, collaboration, and networking.
KCDs are supported by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io/).
