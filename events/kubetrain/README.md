Hop on the KubeTrain on March 31!

[KubeTrain](https://kubetrain.io/) is an initiative to bring fun and sustainable travel to all KubeCon attendees.
The aim of this initiative is to organize groups of people that are willing to travel to the next destination of KubeCon by train.
Our association helps to coordinate a KubeTrain from Lausanne and Geneva.
